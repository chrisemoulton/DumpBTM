In macOS Ventura (13), Apple consolidated persistent items (login items, launch agents/daemons) in a new file: `BackgroundItems-v4.btm` (found in `/private/var/db/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagement/`). 

This file is a serialized binary propertly list. You can dump it via Apple's `sfltool`, specifying the `dumpbtm` command line flag. 

`DumpBTM` is an open-source version of this, which has the following benefits:

* open-source
* programmatic access to enumerate items in the file 

The latter point is most notable as this allow you to now add such logic into security/EDR tools. Spefically you can now easily and programmatically enumerate all (ok most) persistent items on a macOS Ventura system (which will include any persistently installed malware). 

You can also then monitor this file for changes to detect new persistence events (as now you can parse/unserialize its contents via this project's code). 

Note: Such monitoring was supposed to be accomplished via the Endpoint Security `ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD` event ...but this event is broken (See: "[Endpoint Security Event: ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD is ...broken?](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/720468)" ðŸ˜“
