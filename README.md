Note: If you're running the pre-built binary, though signed, it's not notarized (Apple doesn't support notarized commandline tools). So after making it executable, remove the quarantine attributue to make it runnable (via Terminal).

```
% chmod +x dumpBTM
% xattr -rc dumpBTM
```

Also, make sure you give Terminal "Full Disk Access" (a requirment to read the `BackgroundItems-v4.btm` file). 

In macOS Ventura (13), Apple consolidated persistent items (login items, launch agents/daemons) in a new file: `BackgroundItems-v*.btm`, found in `/private/var/db/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagement/`. On macOS 13.0 this file is named `BackgroundItems-v*.btm` whereas on macOS 13.1 it's `BackgroundItems-v7.btm`.

This file is a serialized binary propertly list. You can dump it via Apple's `sfltool`, specifying the `dumpbtm` command line flag. 

`DumpBTM` is an open-source version of this, which has the following benefits:

* Open-source
* Programmatic access to enumerate (persistent) items in the file 

The latter point is most notable as this allow you to now add such logic into security/EDR tools. Specifically you can now easily and programmatically enumerate all (ok most) persistent items on a macOS Ventura system (which will include any persistently installed malware). 

You can also then monitor this file for changes to detect new persistence events (as now you can parse/unserialize its contents via this project's code). 

Note: Such monitoring was supposed to be accomplished via the Endpoint Security `ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD` event ...but this event is broken (See: "[Endpoint Security Event: ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD is ...broken?](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/720468)" ðŸ˜“).
